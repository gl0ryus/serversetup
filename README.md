# Intro!

Hi, this will be a quick guide on the tools I use to setup a server I get from HBD (hostingby.design). I've tried casual seedbox services in the past to boost my ratios on sites like IPT/TD/TL. These site post a lot of content and can generally push a lot of data. In my testing (Ultra and Whatbox's NVMe plans) don't beat the lowest priced HBD dedicated servers and are still managed, I.E. if you have problems they can help you. Their staff, dwalker and jiikoo are wizards and overall good people. My experience at Ultra wasn't the cleanest, told they don't support the tools to race like the used too... 

So lets start with what this will cover.
- [ ] [Tabby.sh](https://tabby.sh/)

  Feel free to use your prefferred ssh client. This is my personal choice.
  
- [ ] Using [Autobrr](https://autobrr.com)

   The modern replacement to autodl-irssi. It got a sleek web-ui and is still actively developed.
 
- [ ] [Qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
   
   This client is feature rich and with the tuning done by the HBD wizards it performs equally to the former champ deluge.
   
- [ ] [Nightwalker](https://github.com/brettpetch/nightwalker)

   A theme to give us a dark ui and ratio colors.

- [ ] [qbittools](https://gitlab.com/AlexKM/qbittools#reannounce-with-systemd)

   A tool to organize torrents and automate tasks.
   
- [ ] [autoremove-torrents](https://autoremove-torrents.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

   Automation to remove torrents based on rules we create.
