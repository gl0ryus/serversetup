# Intro!

Hi, this will be a quick guide on the tools I use to setup a server I get from HBD (hostingby.design). I've tried casual seedbox services in the past to boost my ratios on sites like IPT/TD/TL. These site post a lot of content and can generally push a lot of data. In my testing (Ultra and Whatbox's NVMe plans) don't beat the lowest priced HBD dedicated servers and are still managed, I.E. if you have problems they can help you. Their staff, dwalker and jiikoo are wizards and overall good people. My experience at Ultra wasn't the cleanest, told they don't support the tools to race like the used too... 

So lets start with what this will cover.
- [ ] [Autobrr](https://autobrr.com)

 The modern replacement to autodl-irssi. It got a sleep web-ui and is still actively developed.
 
- [ ] [Qbittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
- [ ] [qbittools](https://gitlab.com/AlexKM/qbittools#reannounce-with-systemd)
